_**Premise**_

`“Any application that can be written in JavaScript, will eventually be written in JavaScript.” -Jeff Atwood ` 

This was said back in 2007, and we can say that it is proving true till now. You can think of any technical keyword and there might be a JavaScript library build around it. So if it’s so popular and in demand, this can be a great programming language to learn. But that’s not the only skill that is required, since you have to apply this to solve practical problems. And one of such problems is to build scalable products.

**Gen Z backend**

After jQuery animation dev shifted to a single page application for better control of ui/ux and thus came frontend frameworks such as angular js and angular. After that JavaScript was made available to port into literally any modern machine that exists and runs as a standalone application i.e Node.js. It was widely accepted as a backend framework and comes to the top, 2nd year in a row in 2020 of StackOverflow survey.

As developers are busy getting an experience in node.js it’s nice to have a curated list of **Node.js interview questions** to revise. Also, to further consolidate your knowledge on Javascript, refer to this [source](https://www.interviewbit.com/javascript-interview-questions/).

### 1\. What is Node.js and how it works?

Node.js is a virtual machine that uses JavaScript as its scripting language and runs Chrome’s V8 JavaScript engine. Basically, Node.js is based ==on an event-driven architecture== where I/O runs asynchronously making it lightweight and efficient. It is being used in developing desktop applications as well with a popular framework called electron as it provides API to access OS-level features such as file system, network, etc.

Here is a [Free course](https://www.scaler.com/topics/course/nodejs/) on Node.js for beginners to master the fundamentals of Node.js.

### 2\. What tools can be used to assure consistent code style?

==ESLint== can be used with any IDE to ensure a consistent coding style which further helps in maintaining the codebase. 

### 3\. What is a ==first class function== in Javascript?

When functions can be treated like any other variable then those functions are first-class functions. There are many other programming languages, for example, ==scala, Haskell==, etc which follow this including JS. Now because of this function can be passed as a param to another function(callback) or a function can return another function(higher-order function). map() and filter() are higher-order functions that are popularly used.

### 4\. How do you ==manage packages== in your node.js project?

It can be managed by a number of package installers and their configuration file accordingly. Out of them mostly use ==npm== or yarn. Both provide almost all libraries of javascript with extended features of controlling environment-specific configurations. To maintain versions of libs being installed in a project we use package.json and package-lock.json so that there is no issue in porting that app to a different environment.

### 5\. How is Node.js better than other frameworks most popularly used?

* Node.js provides simplicity in development because of its non-blocking I/O and event-based model results in short response time and concurrent processing, unlike other frameworks where developers have to use thread management.
* It runs on a chrome v8 engine which is written in c++ and is highly performant with constant improvement.
* Also since we will use Javascript in both the frontend and backend the development will be much faster.
* And at last, there are sample libraries so that we don’t need to reinvent the wheel.

### 6\. Explain the steps how “Control Flow” controls the functions calls?

* Control the order of execution
* Collect data
* Limit concurrency
* Call the following step in the program.

### 7\. What are some commonly used timing features of Node.js?

* **setTimeout/clearTimeout** – This is used to implement delays in code execution.
* **setInterval/clearInterval** – This is used to run a code block multiple times.
* **setImmediate/clearImmediate** – Any function passed as the setImmediate() argument is a callback that's executed in the next iterationof the event loop.
* **process.nextTick** – Both setImmediate and process.nextTick appear to be doing the same thing; however, you may prefer one over the other depending on your callback’s urgency.

### 8\. What are the advantages of using promises instead of callbacks?

The main advantage of using promise is you get an object to decide the action that needs to be taken after the async task completes. This gives more manageable code and avoids callback hell.

### 9\. What is fork in node JS?

A fork in general is used to spawn child processes. In node it is used to create a new instance of v8 engine to run multiple workers to execute the code.

### 10\. Why is Node.js single-threaded?

Node.js was created explicitly as an experiment in async processing. This was to try a new theory of doing async processing on a single thread over the existing thread-based implementation of scaling via different frameworks.

### 11\. How do you create a simple server in Node.js that returns Hello World?

```javascript
var http = require("http");
http.createServer(function (request, response) {
  response.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'text/plain'});
  response.end('Hello World\n');
}).listen(3000);
```

### 12\. How many types of API functions are there in Node.js?

There are two types of API functions:

* **Asynchronous, non-blocking functions** \- mostly I/O operations which can be fork out of the main loop.
* **Synchronous, blocking functions** \- mostly operations that influence the process running in the main loop.

### 13\. What is REPL?

PL in Node.js stands for **R**ead, **E**val, **P**rint, and **L**oop, which further means evaluating code on the go.

### 14\. List down the two arguments that async.queue takes as input?

* Task Function
* Concurrency Value

### 15\. What is the purpose of module.exports?

This is used to expose functions of a particular module or file to be used elsewhere in the project. This can be used to encapsulate all similar functions in a file which further improves the project structure.

For example, you have a file for all utils functions with util to get solutions in a different programming language of a problem statement.

```dart
const getSolutionInJavaScript = async ({
 problem_id
}) => {
...
};
const getSolutionInPython = async ({
 problem_id
}) => {
...
};
module.exports = { getSolutionInJavaScript, getSolutionInPython }
```

Thus using module.exports we can use these functions in some other file:

```javascript
const { getSolutionInJavaScript, getSolutionInPython} = require("./utils")
```

## Advanced Node.js Interview Questions

### 1\. What is an Event Emitter in Node.js?

EventEmitter is a Node.js class that includes all the objects that are basically capable of emitting events. This can be done by attaching named events that are emitted by the object using an eventEmitter.on() function. Thus whenever this object throws an even the attached functions are invoked synchronously.

```scala
const EventEmitter = require('events');
class MyEmitter extends EventEmitter {}
const myEmitter = new MyEmitter();
myEmitter.on('event', () => {
 console.log('an event occurred!');
});
myEmitter.emit('event');
```

### 2\. Enhancing Node.js performance through clustering.

Node.js applications run on a single processor, which means that by default they don’t take advantage of a multiple-core system. Cluster mode is used to start up multiple node.js processes thereby having multiple instances of the event loop. When we start using cluster in a nodejs app behind the scene multiple node.js processes are created but there is also a parent process called the **cluster manager** which is responsible for monitoring the health of the individual instances of our application.

Clustering in Node.js

### 3\. What is a thread pool and which library handles it in Node.js

The Thread pool is handled by the libuv library. libuv is a multi-platform C library that provides support for asynchronous I/O-based operations such as file systems, networking, and concurrency. 

![](https://proxy-prod.omnivore-image-cache.app/0x0,sxqQPtJCNeXyDZroHrxO66LdICZdK9MMsepu3qnzUj3M/https://s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/myinterviewtrainer-domestic/public_assets/assets/000/000/047/original/nodejs-thread-pool.png?1614761759)

Thread Pool

### 4\. What is WASI and why is it being introduced?

Web assembly provides an implementation of [WebAssembly System Interface](https://wasi.dev/) specification through WASI API in node.js implemented using WASI class. The introduction of WASI was done by keeping in mind its possible to use the underlying operating system via a collection of POSIX-like functions thus further enabling the application to use resources more efficiently and features that require system-level access.

### 5\. How are worker threads different from clusters?

**Cluster:**

* There is one process on each CPU with an IPC to communicate.
* In case we want to have multiple servers accepting HTTP requests via a single port, clusters can be helpful.
* The processes are spawned in each CPU thus will have separate memory and node instance which further will lead to memory issues.

**Worker threads:**

* There is only one process in total with multiple threads.
* Each thread has one Node instance (one event loop, one JS engine) with most of the APIs accessible.
* Shares memory with other threads (e.g. SharedArrayBuffer)
* This can be used for CPU-intensive tasks like processing data or accessing the file system since NodeJS is single-threaded, synchronous tasks can be made more efficient leveraging the worker's threads.

### 6\. How to measure the duration of async operations?

Performance API provides us with tools to figure out the necessary performance metrics. A simple example would be using async\_hooks and perf\_hooks

```typescript
'use strict';
const async_hooks = require('async_hooks');
const {
 performance,
 PerformanceObserver
} = require('perf_hooks');
const set = new Set();
const hook = async_hooks.createHook({
 init(id, type) {
if (type === 'Timeout') {
  performance.mark(`Timeout-${id}-Init`);
  set.add(id);
}
 },
 destroy(id) {
if (set.has(id)) {
  set.delete(id);
  performance.mark(`Timeout-${id}-Destroy`);
  performance.measure(`Timeout-${id}`,
                      `Timeout-${id}-Init`,
                      `Timeout-${id}-Destroy`);
}
 }
});
hook.enable();
const obs = new PerformanceObserver((list, observer) => {
 console.log(list.getEntries()[0]);
 performance.clearMarks();
 observer.disconnect();
});
obs.observe({ entryTypes: ['measure'], buffered: true });
setTimeout(() => {}, 1000);
```

This would give us the exact time it took to execute the callback.

### 7\. How to measure the performance of async operations?

Performance API provides us with tools to figure out the necessary performance metrics.

A simple example would be:

```coffeescript
const { PerformanceObserver, performance } = require('perf_hooks');
const obs = new PerformanceObserver((items) => {
 console.log(items.getEntries()[0].duration);
 performance.clearMarks();
});
obs.observe({ entryTypes: ['measure'] });
performance.measure('Start to Now');
performance.mark('A');
doSomeLongRunningProcess(() => {
 performance.measure('A to Now', 'A');
 performance.mark('B');
 performance.measure('A to B', 'A', 'B');
});
```
