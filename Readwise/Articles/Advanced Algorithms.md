- Document Note: 1. How does the Union-Find data structure optimize the process of detecting cycles in a dynamic graph compared to traditional methods like DFS?
   2. What are the implications of using path compression and union by rank on the efficiency of the Union-Find operations, and how do these techniques impact the overall time complexity?
   3. In what scenarios would Union-Find be preferred over other graph traversal algorithms, and what are the limitations of this approach?
- Summary: Union-Find is a data structure used to track connected nodes in a dynamic graph and detect cycles. It works with disjoint sets, ensuring that vertices being united are not already connected. The main operations are "find," which locates the root parent of a vertex, and "union," which combines two sets if they are not already connected.
