AWS Certification digital badges now provided via Credly’s Acclaim platform.

AWS Certification provides digital badges as a benefit of getting AWS Certified to showcase certification status. With digital badges on Credly’s Acclaim platform, you now have more flexible options for recognition and verification. Take advantage of one-click badge sharing on social media newsfeeds, tools for embedding verifiable badges on websites, and an optional public profile with all earned AWS Certification badges.

Login to https://www.aws.training/certification and check for current badges achieved under Digital Badges (retiring) tab.
