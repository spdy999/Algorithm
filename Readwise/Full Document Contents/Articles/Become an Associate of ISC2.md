## Full Document
For cybersecurity professionals with the ability to pass an ISC2 exam but who lack the required work experience to earn certification, the Associate of ISC2 designation has you covered.

Passing one of ISC2â€™s rigorous exams is an outstanding achievement. The Associate of ISC2 badge demonstrates to employers that you have what it takes to add value to their cybersecurity team now as you progress on your journey to certification. It also means you are part of the global ISC2 community, with access to a broad array of professional development opportunities as you obtain the required work experience, advance your career and ultimately earn your certification.

#### How does it work?

The Associate of ISC2 designation can be earned by anyone who passes an exam for a certification requiring work experience.

After you pass your exam and receive official notice from ISC2 to begin the certification application process, select Associate of ISC2 if you do not yet have the required work experience. You will be prompted to pay your first Annual Maintenance Fee (AMF) of U.S. $50. You will then join our global community of cybersecurity professionals who are working every day to achieve our vision of a safe and secure cyber world.
