delivery of IT capabilities where

IT infrastructure and applications

are provided to clients over the network.

It's essentially virtualization,

allowing us to deploy servers,

systems, and infrastructure virtually.

infrastructure from anywhere in the world,

making it a convenient alternative to on-premises

solutions so instead of

traditional server deployment and networking,

we opt for virtualization.

there are some key characteristics to keep in mind.

This means you can get what you

need from the Cloud whenever you want.

In a nutshell, it's all about making sure that

authorized clients get access to the resources they need.

For example, you're running

a web server for an e-commerce website.

the number of requests can

as people from all over

the world visit your bustling e-commerce site.

It allows you to increase

server capacity to manage the higher load seamlessly.

When a new request comes in,

it can be automatically routed to a newly added server,

distributing the load more evenly.

it's all about paying for what you

actually use on an hourly basis.

the traditional approach of buying

new setups and maintaining on-premises servers,

which can be quite expensive.

which means you don't have to

worry about manual tasks like

data backups and security

because everything is automated.

Even perimeter gateway services,

including patches and other maintenance are automated,

reducing the need for manual intervention.

The final characteristic we are going to

discuss is virtualization technology.

It's all about how we deploy our virtual computers,

and the process is similar

to how we set up physical machines.
