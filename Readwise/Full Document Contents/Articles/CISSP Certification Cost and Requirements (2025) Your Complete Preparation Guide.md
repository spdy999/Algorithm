#### Understanding CISSP certification

The CISSP certification is designed and issued by the International Information System Security Certification Consortium (ISC2), and it serves as proof of a candidate’s knowledge and skills in a range of information security disciplines. It consists of [eight domains](https://www.infosecinstitute.com/resources/cissp/the-cissp-domains-an-overview/):

* Security and Risk Management
* Asset Security
* Security Architecture and Engineering
* Communication and Network Security
* Identity and Access Management (IAM)
* Security Assessment and Testing
* Security Operations
* Software Development Security

These eight domains require candidates to have a broad range of cybersecurity knowledge in order to pass the exam and obtain certification.

#### Prerequisites for CISSP certification

To [earn your CISSP certification,](https://www.infosecinstitute.com/training/cissp/?utm_source=resources&utm_medium=infosec+network&utm_campaign=course+pricing&utm_content=hyperlink) you have to have at least five years of cumulative, full-time work experience in at least two of the eight domains mentioned above. You can satisfy as much as one year of required experience by earning a bachelor’s or master’s degree in computer science, information technology or a connected field. Another way to earn up to one year of qualifying experience is to get another credential from the ISC2’s approved list. You can find the list of credentials on [ISC2’s site](https://www.isc2.org/certifications/cissp/cissp-experience-requirements), but some include:

* [CompTIA Security+](https://www.infosecinstitute.com/training/security-plus/?utm_source=resources&utm_medium=infosec+network&utm_campaign=course+pricing&utm_content=hyperlink)
* [CompTIA Advanced Security Practitioner (CASP+)](https://www.infosecinstitute.com/training/casp-plus/?utm_source=resources&utm_medium=infosec+network&utm_campaign=course+pricing&utm_content=hyperlink)
* [AWS Certified Security - Specialty](https://www.infosecinstitute.com/courses/aws-certified-security-engineer-boot-camp/?utm_source=resources&utm_medium=infosec+network&utm_campaign=course+pricing&utm_content=hyperlink)
* [Certified Information Systems Auditor (CISA)](https://www.infosecinstitute.com/training/cisa/?utm_source=resources&utm_medium=infosec+network&utm_campaign=course+pricing&utm_content=hyperlink)

Common questions around CISSP requirements include:

* **Can a beginner get CISSP certification?** This certification isn’t designed for those who have no experience in cybersecurity. Rather, it’s geared towards those who want to leverage their experience to pursue higher-paying positions, so it’s a common [cybersecurity manager certification.](https://www.infosecinstitute.com/resources/professional-development/best-information-security-management-certifications/) You need to meet the experiential requirements outlined above to get your official CISSP certification.
* **Can you take the CISSP without any experience?**Yes. You can still take the CISSP exam even if you don’t have experience, but you will not earn your full certification. Instead, the ISC2 will grant you the title of Associate of ISC2. Then, you have up to six years to earn the five years of necessary experience.

#### Breakdown of CISSP certification costs

The CISSP exam costs $749 at the time of this writing (but see the [ISC2 website](https://www.isc2.org/register-for-exam/isc2-exam-pricing) for the most up-to-date pricing). If you have to reschedule your exam, there’s a $50 fee, and if you cancel your exam, there is a $100 fee.

In addition to the actual cost of paying for the exam, it’s a good idea to factor in expenses associated with:

* **Study materials:** For instance, the Official CISSP Study Guide from Sybex costs around $60 on Amazon.
* **Training course fees:**The amount you end up paying will vary depending on the type of training you choose. A live [CISSP Certification Boot Camp](https://www.infosecinstitute.com/courses/cissp-boot-camp/?utm_source=resources&utm_medium=infosec+network&utm_campaign=course+pricing&utm_content=hyperlink) costs more than on-demand CISSP training courses; however, a boot camp usually includes all the other costs mentioned here.
* **Membership fees:** Once you hold your CISSP certification, you must pay an annual maintenance fee of $135, which also serves as your ISC2 membership fee.

Also, if you become an associate of ISC2 by passing the exam before having the necessary experience, you must pay an annual maintenance fee of $50.

#### Preparing for the CISSP exam

To put yourself in the best position to pass the exam, you can take advantage of the following study materials and resources:

* **Official ISC2 publications,** such as the organization’s CISSP study guide and practice tests, give an overview of the eight domains, each domain’s content and the kinds of questions you can expect to encounter.
* **Third-party prep courses:**Courses from reputable providers, such as Infosec’s [CISSP training](https://www.infosecinstitute.com/skills/content-library/?q=cissp&utm_source=resources&utm_medium=infosec+network&utm_campaign=skills+pricing&utm_content=hyperlink), can give you a strategic edge because they provide deep, focused learning experiences custom-designed to help you ace the exam.
* **Online communities:** You can access discussion boards, such as [Reddit’s CISSP board](https://www.reddit.com/r/cissp/) or [TechExam's CISSP board](https://community.infosecinstitute.com/categories/cissp), to learn from others' experiences and get tips from those who’ve passed the test.
* **Practice exams:**In addition to the free practice questions offered by ISC2, you can also purchase full practice exams online or use the practice exams provided in third-party prep courses.

Even though your prep routine will vary according to your learning style, here are some best practices that others have found helpful:

* **Develop a systematic study plan:**Set aside time each day, and make sure you cover each domain thoroughly. If you come across a challenging topic, it’s good to swing back and revisit it later.
* **Use a range of resources:** For example, a combination of practice tests, study guides and guided instruction is often more beneficial than training with only one method.
* **Set up a practice schedule:**You should take practice exams periodically because they reinforce your knowledge and help you get used to tackling many questions in a single sitting.
* **Strengthen your weaknesses:**If you feel less confident in certain domains, spend time strengthening those areas. Similarly, if you feel confident but end up scoring low on a certain domain on a practice test, use this as feedback and circle back to those topics.

#### Value of CISSP certification in 2024 and beyond

Many professionals use the CISSP certification to differentiate themselves from other candidates in the field. As a result, it’s common for those with this certification to enjoy:

* **Better job prospects:**Some employees require CISSP certification before applying for leadership roles or senior positions. In fact, the CISSP is the most requested certification in U.S. job listings.

* **Higher salaries:**Those with their CISSP certification may earn more than those without because some companies feel more comfortable increasing compensation for certified professionals. Read our [CISSP salary guide](https://www.infosecinstitute.com/resources/cissp/average-cissp-salary/) for more information.

* **Enhanced professional development:** Because earning your CISSP certification demonstrates a commitment to cybersecurity excellence, having this in your professional development portfolio can make it easier to advance your career.

The CISSP has remained a top-requested certification for many years, and its value doesn’t appear to be slowing down. By hiring CISSP-certified staff, organizations can ensure those new hires have the validated knowledge and on-the-job experience needed to help keep data and systems secure.

The [CEH](https://www.infosecinstitute.com/training/ceh/?utm_source=resources&utm_medium=infosec+network&utm_campaign=course+pricing&utm_content=hyperlink) is a more entry-level certification focused on offensive security.
