In this article, we will look at the costs of taking the CEH exam, including registration fees, study materials, and potential additional expenses. By the end, you will know how much the EC-Council CEH exam costs.

#### Purpose of the CEH certification

The main reason to get the CEH certification in ethical hacking is to show that you are an expert in ethical hacking and information security. This certification sets a standard for ethical hacking by making sure certified individuals have the right skills to find and fix weaknesses in computer systems and networks.

The CEH certification is popular because it covers ethical hacking techniques, tools, and methods comprehensively. It's different from other industry standards and helps professionals understand the latest security threats and defenses.

Employers appreciate certified ethical hackers with practical skills in penetration testing, detecting intrusion, and network scanning. They also value knowledge of cyber security laws like GDPR and HIPAA. Getting the CEH certification shows professionals can find and fix security risks, making them very valuable to employers.

#### CEH Exam Cost

The cost of the Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH) exam can vary depending on several factors, including your location, the type of exam delivery (in-person proctored or online proctored), and any additional study materials or resources you may choose to purchase.

Exam application and registration fees

* Training prep course costs
* Study materials
* Practice exams

CEH exam fees may be higher than others, like CompTIA Security+ and Pentest+, due to additional expenses for EC-Council official training and study materials.

##### Mandatory training costs

When pursuing the CEH certification, candidates should be aware of the mandatory training costs associated with the exam.

These costs cover the expense of preparing for the certification and can include the fees for training courses, study materials, and practice exams.

In comparison to other expenses related to the CEH exam, such as the application fee and exam voucher, mandatory training costs can be a significant factor to consider when budgeting for the certification process.

Additionally, candidates should also take into account any additional costs beyond the exam fees, such as travel expenses and accommodations if attending in-person training sessions, as well as the potential need for retaking the exam.

Understanding and carefully considering the mandatory training costs and other related expenses involved in obtaining the CEH certification is important for candidates as they plan and prepare for the examination.

##### Additional costs beyond exam fees

Obtaining a CEH certification may bring extra costs besides the exam fees. These include study materials, training courses, and practice exams. The amount varies based on the individual's preferred study methods and resources.

Compared to other cybersecurity certifications like CompTIA Pentest+, the additional costs for obtaining a CEH certification might be higher due to the specific study materials and training prep courses required for CEH exam preparation. These added costs can significantly impact the overall investment in obtaining a CEH certification, contributing to the total cost of preparing for and taking the exam.

Individuals should consider and budget for these additional costs when planning to pursue a CEH certification. This will help them make an informed decision about the overall financial investment required.

It's important for candidates to budget for these extra costs to be fully prepared for the exam.

#### CEH Exam Cost for Recertification - process & fees

After getting the Certified Ethical Hacker certification, individuals need to recertify every three years. This involves earning specific continuing education credits called EC-Council Continuing Education (ECE) credits. There are associated fees for the recertification process to cover administration and processing. These fees are mandatory to maintain the CEH certification status.
