Hi there, I am back with another certification success story and study tips. This time it’s for the new AWS Certified Security — Specialty exam SCS-C02 which was released in July 2023. New exam domains have been updated and you can read about this here: <https://tutorialsdojo.com/whats-new-in-aws-certified-security-specialty-scs-c02-exam-in-2023/>

### Exam Prep Strategy

I have been using Trevor Spires’ exam prep strategy and it totally works for me and it’s proven to be successful. For those unfamiliar with Trevor, he’s a developer advocate and AWS solutions architect (<https://www.linkedin.com/in/trevspires/>). Here’s a link to his strategy video which has helped me tremendously and I suggest you watch this as well — <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6Xy1v2w1_M>. I had taken the first version of this exam back in 2019 so it was time to refresh my knowledge and renew this extremely valuable certification.

### Study schedule (4 week method):

1. Spend first 2 weeks to go through the entire Stephane Maarek Udemy course
2. Once familiar with the material spend the remaining 2 weeks on practice tests. Do a full practice exam in order to time yourself. Once completed, review the questions you got wrong thoroughly. If required go back to Stephane’s course to re-watch the lectures or refer to AWS documentation and study the Tutorials Dojo explanations for each answer thoroughly. Lab out the concepts you do not understand, this will help commit to memory. For example, create a CloudFront distribution and explore all the security settings like Origin Access Control, Origin Access Identity, S3 bucket policies, etc. depending on what concept you are struggling with. As far as labs go, if you really want to go further beyond the exam topics you can pick any of these mini projects by Adrian Cantrill: <https://www.reddit.com/r/AWSCertifications/comments/v1d647/free_mini_projectsadvanced_demoslabs_for_aws/>.
3. Day before the exam: Review topics you are most uncomfortable with again, re-watch the videos and review the exam questions and explanations again. Use the flash cards feature in Tutorials Dojo to test yourself.

### **Conclusion**

I hope this is helpful and gives ideas on how to manage your time if you are on a busy schedule like myself with a full time job and family but need to get that certification renewed and gain new skills through a structured approach.

Cheers!
