## Full Document
Think about how often you encounter thefollowing scenario: there's a task you'retrying to complete, but in order to dothat simple task, you have all thisbackground. You have to have all thesedocuments you have to read, slidepresentations to go over, people you haveto talk to, concepts you have tounderstand. The problem is, who in a crazybusy workday has time to sit down andspend hours reading things?

Hey everyone, about a year ago, Ireleased a YouTube video on a newexperimental AI platform from Googlecalled Notebook LM. But you know, Ithought this is probably not going to goanywhere; it's just a beta, just anexperiment. But let me tell you, I wascompletely wrong. Let me show you thefive biggest new features that NotebookLM has come up with, and no, this video isnot sponsored. Now before I show myscreen, I want to answer what I think isa really fundamental question, which iswhat is Notebook LM,especially how is it unique anddifferent from some of the other AItools out there, like Chat GPT? Well, I wasreading one of the blog posts that the

Notebook LM team had written, and in thatPost, they called it a tool forunderstanding, and I think that‚Äôs thebest simple description. I‚Äôve seen it‚Äôsthe ultimate tool for understandingthings. There‚Äôs a lot to cover, so buckleup, grab a cup of coffee, and let‚Äôs diveright in. First, let‚Äôs talk about audiooverviews. Imagine if you were settingsomething or learning something orreading something, and you just happened tocome across a podcast in your podcastapp between two super engagingknowledgeable hosts explaining thatthing to you. Well, now you don‚Äôt have tobe lucky; you can generate exactly thatconversation on demand anytime you want.

What you see here on my screen is themain interface when you log in atnotebooklm.google.com. It‚Äôs very simple;each one of these squares contains allthe material for a specific project, sothe first thing you‚Äôre usually going todo is click "Create New" and add somesources. These are the sources that youwant it to know about, that you want itto cite and draw from. So the project Ihave in mind is an upcoming trip toGuatemala that my family and I areplanning to take this summer. This isexactly the kind of project that I wouldI love to spend lots of time researching the country, their culture,their history, all the itineraries, thedestinations we could visit, theactivities, the cultural experiences. Butif I'm really honest with myself, it's

also the type of project that is likelynot to be prioritized. I have a lot goingon over the next few months. I'm writinga book, I have two young kids, so it's thekind of thing that I know I really coulduse AI's help with. So, the first thingI'm going to do is look for some sourcesthat I want to draw on, and this can beas simple as opening up Google andtyping "best places to visit in Guatemala."I'm going to scroll through here;these look like great sources, thesethree right here. So, I'm just going tohold down command and click each one ofthem, which opens them up in tabs alongthe top up here. Now, I'm not going toread them; I'm not going to dive into them.

All I want them is to stay open rightthere. Then, let's try YouTube, and hereI'm going to be a little more specific.I'm going to say "underrated places tovisit in Guatemala." So, let's open thisone again. I'm going to hold down commandand click. I'll do that one, and then IEven like that, this one is specificallyabout an underrated location, so let'sadd that one. All right, so this is a goodstart. I have three websites and threeYouTube videos, which might not seem likea lot, but it kind of is. It would take meprobably an hour or two to reallydive deep into those, so what I'm goingto do, instead of reading them myself, isjust add them as sources in Notebook LM.

Let's open up the first website here. I'mgoing to do Command L to highlight theURL here and then Command C to copy it.And then back in Notebook LM, you can seeright down here I can add Google Drivedocuments, I can add links, and I can addpasted text. So I'm going to go ahead andclick website and then Command V topaste, and then insert. Now that I canclick on the source right here, and thislittle purple panel will open up calledThe Source Guide. The Source Guide isjust a one-paragraph summary of thesource. Let's go to our second website.

Command L to highlight the URL, Command C,back to Notebook LM. I'm going to clickthis Add Source button right here at thetop left. Website, paste it, add that aswell. All right, so now I have two sources.I'm just going to take a minute here andDo the same with thislast website,and then it looks much the same withYouTube videos. You just click the video,command L, copy the URL of the YouTubevideo, add Source, this time click YouTubeand paste it rightthere. I just remembered a friend who wasGuatemalan also sent me a country guide,a quite long, extensive PDF kind ofhighlighting and showcasing some of thebest places to visit, so I'm going to goahead and add that as well. To do that,I'll hit add source and this time clickchoose file to add a file from mycomputer, and I can see it's in mydownloads folder right there. There we go.

You can see it right there, and there'sone more thing I want to add, which is inmy notes, which is this suggesteditinerary that the friend who is getting marriedactually suggested for us. Theysuggested a 6-day, 7-night itinerary.I definitely want to take that intoaccount, so I'm going to go ahead and docommand A to select all that text,command C to copy, head back over toNotebookLM, and this time I'm going tohit add source.

It says copied text. What that allows meto do is to simply paste whatever text Iwant right into the little window here.Hit insert and that is now a source aswell. This is a good start; you can seehere I have eight different sources I‚Äômworking with. Before I click this biggenerate button here, I‚Äôm going tocustomize the conversation a little bit.So I‚Äôm going to say just give it somecontext and details.

Then I‚Äôll click generate. This iswhat you‚Äôre going to see; it saysgenerating conversation. There‚Äôs a littlecircle here, and this will take somewherebetween around 3 to 6 minutes. So Iusually go get a cup of coffee, or go tothe bathroom, or just take a littlestretch break while this is generating.

All right, so we‚Äôre fast forwarding herea few minutes ‚Äî 3 or 4 minutes ‚Äî but you cansee here it has now generated a 21minute 12 second podcast conversationthat I would love to share with you now.Here it is! Okay, so get this ‚Äî our listeneris heading to Guatemala in the summer of 2025.Nice! A week, they said, and they want theauthentic experience. Yeah! Did you knowthat some of the world‚Äôs most soughtafter coffee beans come from theThe volcanic slopes surrounding Antigua, I didactually see something about that.

Apparently, Antigua has a boomingcoffee scene, not just plantations, butartisan roasters and cafes. Yeah, Ithink one of the articles recommendedthis place called Artista de Caf√©. Oh,nice! They said it was like this hub forlocal artists and coffee connoisseurs.

I'll go ahead and pause that now, but youcan see that this conversation is notjust perfectly realistic andindistinguishable from a humanconversation, but it's completelycustomized based on the instructionsthat I gave them. But you know what? Youcan even customize this further, and thatis through a beta feature calledinteractive mode, where believe it or not,you can actually click a button and jointhe conversation in real time yourself.

So I've just remembered a key detailthat I forgot to mention. So let's goahead and enter interactive mode andchime in on this conversation. So I'll goahead and start playing the podcastagain. Okay, so get this: our listener isheading to Guatemala in the summer of 2025. Nice!They say a week. So watch what happenswhen I click this join button andInterrupt the conversation. Oh, hey there!

How can we help? Hey, guys, I appreciatethis, but I forgot one key detail, whichis that we're going to have two smallkids with us, ages 2 and 4. Could youplease give us a recommended itinerarytaking that into account? Oh, wow, okay!That's definitely a key detail. Yeah!Traveling with a two and four-year-oldchanges things. Okay, so let's unpack thisand tailor our itinerary a bit. Yeah,we'll need to balance adventure withkid-friendly options. Right? We were aboutto get into how to experience Guatemalalike a local, and honestly, that's totallydoable with kids. It's going to meanadjusting the pace a little. Exactly! Like,maybe fewer super long travel days andmore focus on activities that engageyoung ones. All right, so I don't know ifyou caught that, but this is the mostremarkable demonstration of AI that Ithink I've ever seen. I think this is sopowerful for a few reasons. One isthere are a lot of people out there whodon't learn best by reading. Reading isactually really taxing and boring. Theyneed to listen to it. But there's anotherreason; think about the typicalchat interactions that people have withIn AI, in a chat format, the onus, the burden

is always on you to keep theconversation moving forward. You have tothink of a question. You have to think ofa prompt. You have to keep putting in aneffort to make progress. This iscompletely different. This is Two Hostswho are very knowledgeable about thetopic and the sources, having their ownconversation completely independently ofyou. It‚Äôs more passive in many ways, butthat‚Äôs good very often, especially inyour first encounter with something. Youwant this kind of superficial surfacelevel survey of the landscape. That way,you even know what topics are relevantand what questions to ask. I‚Äôve been usingaudio overviews exactly that way. AnytimeI want just a kind of general summary orsurvey of a topic, I go straight here andgenerate a personalized podcastconversation on that topic. I‚Äôm going togo ahead and close this window here onthe side. One last thing I want toshow you is that you‚Äôre not limited tothe audio overview. If the hosts talkabout something you find interesting andwant to know more about, well, you haveall the sources already loaded up here.

The little chat window allows you to ask anythingyou want. For example, I'm going to say,"Why is Antigua so underrated?"I'm kind of afraid; maybe it's dangerous, maybe it'snot super safe, so I want to know whytourists do not tend to go there.There you go; you can see a much morein-depth, bullet point by bullet pointsummary of what makes it so underrated,and each one of those statements iscited. If you click on one of thoselittle citations, it takes you exactly tothat part of the source that it isreferring to.

Then, the last thing you canalso create structured documents. So,let's say that you are studyingGuatemala, and you really decideyou want to go deeper. If you click thisbutton right here, the study guide, itwill generate an entire document with aquiz, answer key, essay questions, glossaryof key terms. It looks like a lot of thespecific destinations it mentions, soyou're not limited to a surface levelconversation; you can go as deep and asdetailed as you want.

Now, there's one more example of what you can do withaudio overviews that I want to showyou, so let's head back out to the maininterface. I'm going to create a newThe notebook and the example I showed youwith my Guatemala trip was an examplethat uses external sources thatyou can find on the internet. But you canalso use your own internal thoughts,feelings, ideas, journal entries, andthat's what I want to show you next. SoI'm going to go ahead and click onGoogle Docs, and then right down here Ihave my end-of-year journaling. At the endof every year I do something called anannual review or a year-end review whereI think back to the past year and justreflect and journal on differentmilestones that happened, preciousmemories, goals that I achieved, lessons Ilearned, and all that journaling iscontained in this document right here,which I'm going to insert as a sourcecalled Thiago's 2024 year-end journaling.

You can see that there's a summary hereof what this document is about, and I'mjust going to add that single source andgo ahead and generate an audio overview.I'll fast forward a few minutes here, andnow we can listen. Hey everyone, andwelcome to another deep dive with us.Yes, welcome! Today we're going to belooking at Thiago Forte's 2024 year inreview, which is something that heHe recommends people do and, uh, he practiceswhat he preaches. So, yes, he does, and it'salso kind of interesting that heactually expresses some anxiety aboutdoing the review. Oh, really? Even thoughthis is kind of his area of expertise, Iknow. I was going to say this is kind ofhis thing, yeah, is to reflect andreview, and he even has anxiety about it.

He does. He's worried about coming acrossas performative or, you know, not diggingdeep enough. All right, I'll spare you therest of that. What I found so fascinatingabout this is several things. First ofall, it gives me such an interesting kindof outsider perspective on my life. Youknow, I can go back and read my ownjournal entries, but hearing what feelslike two other humans talking about itin depth, they're fascinated by theinsights I've come up with. They'reimpressed at some of the goals thatI've accomplished. They're empathetic andthey sympathize with some of the hardpainful lessons that I had. It reallyhelps me just get out of my ownperspective, uh, see my life from thismore objective point of view, whichhonestly gives me so much moreappreciation and so much more gratitude.

Helps me kind of be more objective abouteven the life and the year that I had.It's just kind of a really powerfultool for personal growth. It's somethingthat I'm definitely going to make partof my journaling practices goingforward. Next up, we have feature numbertwo, which is an expanded context window.

I know this might seem like a boringbackend technical feature. You're like,"Why do I care about this? I don't evenknow what a context window is?" But thisis, in some ways, actually the mostimportant single seemingly backendtechnical feature that completely radicallychanges what is possible with AI. Imagineif you had a guidance counselor whocould recommend the perfect next step inyour learning, based not just on guessingor a few small details about you, but onthe entire history of everything you'veever read and consumed. Notbook LM uses

Google's Gemini 2.0 flash AAI model,which can now take in, get this, up to 50sources, each one of which can have up to500,000 words. Just to do the math foryou, that's up to 25 million words ofcontext. That is so much higher than anyother AI tool out there and basicallymeans you're never going to hit theLimit almost any conceivable use casethat can fit within 25 million words. Butlet me take a step back and explain what acontext window is and why it matters.

Think of AI as having two kinds ofmemory, just like humans. There‚Äôslong-term memory and there‚Äôs short-termmemory. An AI‚Äôs long-term memory isbasically what‚Äôs called its trainingdata‚Äîall the data that went into itscreation. And basically, these days, allthe major AI models have the same trainingdata, more or less, which is theentire internet. They‚Äôre all trained onthe internet, which means paradoxicallythat there‚Äôs no real advantage in itslong-term memory, in its training data,because it‚Äôs the same across all AImodels. Short-term memory is the datathat it‚Äôs working with right now, likewhat is the conversation it‚Äôs havingright now, the problem it‚Äôs trying tosolve, and the person it‚Äôstalking with right now. Most of theadvantage of working with AI now comesfrom that short-term memory‚Äîthespecifics of the problem you‚Äôre tryingto solve, the history of the product oryour company, and your specific skills andresources you have access to.

You've tried and whether they worked ornot, that kind of data which we call yourcontext is what you supply to the AI forit to know something about you. Thecontext window, this term I keep using, issimply the limits of how much contextyou can give the AI. Until recently, itwas maybe a few thousand words or 10,000words, or maybe 30,000 words. Now, withGemini 2.0, that has radicallyexpanded to 25 million words. Let me giveyou some examples. Imagine you work inproduct development and you could loadup an entire folder full of hundreds oreven thousands of in-depth customerinterviews and then ask NotebookLM toevaluate and analyze an idea you havefor a new product based on all thosepast interactions. Imagine if you work ina nonprofit and you can upload anarchive of every single grantyou've ever won, plus a directory ofhundreds of currently open grants, andthen ask it to tell you which grantproposals you're most likely to win.

Then, to actually write the proposal,drawing on the mission statement of yourorganization. Imagine if you're having amysterious medical problem and you canload up your entire medical history andAsk it to identify any recurringpatterns, even across differentspecialties. Imagine if you could uploadthe entirety of your personal notes fromyears of reading, highlighting, andnote-taking. Every time you encountera new idea, such as in a book, you couldask the AI if there are any existingconnections to that idea in your notes.

You know what? Let's make this concrete.Let's actually take that last example ofloading up all your notes and do it inreal time. So I‚Äôm going to go ahead andcreate a new notebook. I actually usea service called Readwise, whichautomatically syncs all of thehighlights that I make from any ebookthat I read, or any onlinearticle or other online content that Isave in a centralized place. Readwiseactually has a partnership with NotebookLM that allows you to export theentirety of all those notes andhighlights to Google Docs in a formatthat‚Äôs perfectly designed to be loadedup into Notebook LM. You can check out myfirst video for more details on how thatworks. What this allows me to do is toopen up my Google Drive here, and I‚Äôll

find five Google Docs worth of all thoseHighlights. So what I'm going to do isselect each of these by holding downCommand as I click them. I'll clickInsert, and there we go. It took about 2minutes, but you can see in this onelittle paragraph right here that it'sessentially summarized a broad swath ofmy learning, my research, my interestsacross over a decade of my life. Thisis where it really gets fun at thisstage because I can ask some reallydeep, penetrating questions about thehistory of my personal growth, mylearning, my education, and my career. Forexample, I can say, "Please summarize alist of my most common recurringinterests based on these.

There we go. We can see takingnotes in Knowledge Management, types of notes,the value of externalizing thoughts,habits and routines, the importance ofmaking connections‚Äîall huge areas ofinterest. But then let me go beyond whatis found in this message here and say,"What are some other ideas, topics, andareas of interest that are likely toresonate with me based on thislist?" So it's essentially like a teachersuggesting other things that I mightwant to learn about.

That and say, "Please create a study guideand reading list to help me dive deeperinto these topics." It's broken up intochapters, and then each chapter has keyquestions, activities, and readings,including my own book. I lovethis, using AI as a tool. Here's a biggerreading list and additionalrecommendations. Each one of theserecommendations is drawing on so muchexisting knowledge about me; they're notrandom or one size fits all. This is aperfectly personalized learningcurriculum that has been generated basedon years of my notetaking. Do you get whyan expanded context window is so

critical? The possibility that this isopening up is a completely different wayof interacting with AI. It's not aboutdesigning these crazy extensive prompts;it's not about meticulously organizingyour sources. It's really just aboutpointing the AI at a massive repositoryof information and letting it do thework. Let's talk about new feature numberthree, which is multimodal sources.Multimodal is just a fancy word thatmeans many different kinds of formats.Notebook LM can now take basically anykind of format that you want to throw at.

There are URLs from web pages andYouTube videos. Like we saw, you can putthem in PDFs, in text documents, Google Docs,or audio files. You could take a littlevoice memo note while walking aroundyour neighborhood and then upload that.But the most exciting and newest feature isimages, specifically images within GoogleSlides. Think about how often youencounter information in modern work,especially in the form of slides,presentations that someone is giving toyou or you‚Äôre giving to someone else.

Sales calls and technical specificationsslides are a very common format thesedays, and you can now work with thosedirectly in Notebook LM. Let me show youwhat that looks like. As always, I‚Äôllstart by creating a new notebook, andthen I‚Äôm going to click right here whereit says Google Slides, go over to recentand let‚Äôs use, as an example, a recentpresentation that was sent to us by ourinsurance agent proposing a couple of newhealth benefits packages for ouremployees. This is the kind ofinformation that is important; it has highstakes and it matters that I pay attentionto it. But it‚Äôs also just so incrediblymind-numbingly boring that I want to spend asI want to spend as little time loading up this informationinto my brain as possible, so I've loadedit up as a source, as you can see here.

You can see there's a little summary,which is that they‚Äôre proposing twonew health benefits packages. Okay, so myfirst question is, please compare andcontrast the two proposed packages.You can see here, there's a summary comparingtheir deductibles, their office visit costs, monthly, and annual costs. Butyou know, this is a little bit tooextensive, so I‚Äôm going to say pleasesummarize more succinctly: what is thecore difference between these plans?

There we go; the core difference is inthe cost of office visits and theoverall monthly cost, with A1 the firstoption being more expensive. So, as thefounder and CEO of this business, that isreally the bottom line for me. I don‚Äôtreally need to know all the fine-graindetails; that is for our insurance agent.That‚Äôs for the operations person on myteam. The decision of which plan to gowith falls to me, and what matters atthe end of the day is the cost. So, I‚Äômactually going to ask it to perform ananalysis of what the cost differencewould be between these two plans for six.

Employees, over the course of a year,and there we go, its analysis is that thefirst A1 plan would cost $15,000, almost$166,000 more per year. So this is thepart that is actually most important tome. I'm actually going to highlight thispart and say "Save to note," which is whatI do anytime the AI gives me somethingthat is actually valuable long-term thatI want to keep track of. I just clickthat button and it saves it over here inthis little, uh, right-hand bottom corner.But the purpose of this demonstrationwas to show you how it works with imagesand slides. So what I'm going to do islet's say I would like to know thesource of this. I want to check that it'saccurate myself. I can go ahead and clickthis little one here, which is thecitation, and it takes me directly to thetable where it shows that pricedifference. So notice when we look at theslides here, how complex this informationis. It's multicolored, it's in columns,rows, it is not an easy thing to absorb.

But diagrams, charts, images,photographs, all these kinds of things, ifthey're embedded in slides, can now beunderstood by Notebook LM, and that's themultimodal capability. Now, let's talkAbout feature number four, which is aredesigned interface. If we head back toour Guatemala notebook as an example, thewhole interface for a given notebook isdivided into these three columns, whichthey call panels. On the left is thesources panel. This is simply whatsources the AI is working with anddrawing from. You can expand that oronce you've settled on thesources and you're not going to do a lotof changes here, you can just collapsethat, so you have more space for theother ones. The second panel, which isthis middle part, is the chat panel, whichis where you actually speak with andinteract with the AI. It's nice to makethis large because sometimes it givesquite extensive answers that you want tobe able to see in this wider format. Forexample, if I click this question, "Whatcultural and historical significanceshapes Guatemala's top destinations?" youcan see it's probably around 500 words.

So if I like this answer and I decide Iwant to keep it for later, I can justscroll down, click the "Save to Note"button, and it saves just this one answerwhich I've decided is valuable. Over here,on the bottom right, this is called theThe studio panel, this one on the right,does a number of things. This is whereyou create and interact with audiooverviews. It's where you have thesepre-made options, such as creating astudy guide, a briefing document, or afrequently asked questions or timeline.

For example, if I click the FAQ button,it's now generated in a question-and-answer format,a summary of the differentsources that we're working with. So I cango ahead and close that, but I‚Äôd say themost important part is these notes. Whenyou have a conversation with an AI,unless you take action, it kind of alljust disappears over time. So you want tobe sure, if you get a good answer, to justclick that little "save to note" button.And over time, you'll have here at thebottom right, almost, you can think of itlike the final output: the gems, theEvergreen insights that you want to takeaway from this conversation are allgoing to be saved here in the notessection. So that's the overall interface,but for me, by far, the most important newaddition over the last year has beenthese little numbers. See those? There'skind of a big problem with most modernAI tools, which is they hallucinate. TheyMaking things up is something of aparadox because the more you depend onAI to execute important tasks and evenmake decisions, the less you can trust it,

because you never know if it'shallucinating. One thing I reallyappreciate about the NotebookLM team'sphilosophy is that from the veryearliest prototypes, they had this idea of sourcegrounding. What source grounding means isthat especially for information that isin the context window, that short-termmemory that we've talked about, it‚Äôsbasically not going to hallucinate or,very, very rarely; you can check that it‚Äôsnot hallucinating. You can essentiallydouble-check the AI's answers by simplyclicking one of these little numbers,which are the source citations. I'm goingto go ahead and click on the 16, and itnot only opens up the original source,which is this YouTube video, it takes meto and highlights exactly the point thatthat came from. This is a huge deal, youguys; you have to be able to trust whatthe AI is telling you. This newinterface with inline citations is ahuge step forward for that. Finally,feature number five‚Äîlet‚Äôs talk about it.

For the very first time, there is now aThe paid upgraded version of NotebookLM, thebasic version, which is most of whatyou've seen here, is free, and I wouldexpect it to remain free. Most ofGoogle's core tools are free, but if youwork on a team, company, ororganization that wants to use NotebookLM,it may be worth checking out. There'sactually three separate ways to getNotebookLM Plus, either through GoogleWorkspace, which you may have as part ofyour company, through Google Cloud, orthrough Google One, which can bepurchased individually. The pricingdepends on exactly how you purchase it,but it seems to be something around $20per month. There are four main thingsthat you get as part of NotebookLM Plus.

The first one is an even bigger contextwindow, so instead of 25 million words,you can have, and this is just kind ofmind-boggling, upto 15 million words. The only use case Ican think of for that is if you're at acompany and you want to put in allof the company's data into a prompt. Thesecond thing you get is five timeshigher usage limits, so that means youcan create five times more audiooverviews and have five times more.

Notebooks are again mostly useful if you'reworking with a lot of other people on ateam or in a company. The third feature is what are called chat modes. Ifyou click on this button right here, youcan give Notebook LM certain, almost likepersonalities that it takes on in yourinteractions. So let's say in thisconversation you want it to take on therole of an analyst. It will become morecritical and more analytical, or it couldbe more of a guide, almost like a teacher.

You can also define your own personality.So let's say you wanted to act as amarketing expert, or a life coach, or aresearch assistant. You can actuallydefine that and describe it right herein this box, and then you can alsocustomize it to make its responseslonger or shorter. But the fourth, and Ithink by far the most important feature, is the ability to collaboratewithin Notebook LM. Think about it. Haveyou ever had a particularly interestinginteraction with an AI? You're gettingsome real insights and some real newperspectives, and then you think, "I wantto share this." There's often not an easyway to do that, except copying andpasting things and sending them toPeople can interact via email, Slack, or whatever,but then you lose all the interaction.

It's just a static piece of text withthe added potential that you could actually get this entirenotebook. Click this share button righthere, customize the permissions at awelcome note if you‚Äôd like, and thenchoose whether you want to share thefull notebook with all the sources thatyou‚Äôve added, with all the customizations,and with all the notes you saved. Or you canmake it chat-only. You could give thepeople on your team, or the people whowork for you, your employees, or evenexternal collaborators the ability totalk with and go back and forth with theessentially custom AI model that you‚Äôvecreated, without you having to copy andpaste stuff. Once you‚Äôve decided on thesettings, all you have to do is clickthis link right here to copy the linkand send it to them, and they‚Äôll haveaccess via their own free GoogleNotebookLM account. Overall, I would saythis makes the most sense forpeople who have adopted NotebookLMpretty seriously and are using it withothers as part of companies. Like Isaid, okay, I‚Äôve shared a lot with you, solet‚Äôs take a step back and kind ofSummarize the big picture here. I thinkthe big shift that's happening right now

with NotebookLM, with this much biggercontext window, is just like a greatteacher. It's gaining a really fantasticshort-term memory. Think about howimportant it is that a great teacher canfollow the thread of the topic that it'steaching you. A great teacher canreference previous conversations, whatyou just said a few minutes ago. They canthink into the future and plan outdifferent stages of a curriculum thatthey're going to be teaching andcoaching you through. We're living in atime of just incredibly fast change, inno small part because of AI. But ifthere's one thing that I can say forcertain, it's that we're all going tohave to learn much faster and much moreoften. Having an AI-powered world-classteacher with a fantastic memory sittingnext to you and guiding you through thisunpredictable landscape is just a worldchanging and even life-changingphenomenon that we all now have accessto. If anything that I covered resonated,I encourage you to create a free accountat notebooklm.google.com and let meknow what you think.
