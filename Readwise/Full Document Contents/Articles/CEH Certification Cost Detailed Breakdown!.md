#### CEH Certification Cost

Individual circumstances can significantly affect the financial commitment needed for a Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH). The official CEH exam preparation course offers test vouchers to enrolled candidates but they still have to pay an administrative fee of $100 referred to as ‘CEH exam cost’. However, a different case scenario arises where those who qualify for this examination based on their professional background are required to pay an examination fee of $1,199 in addition to a $100 processing fee.

The amount charged for a retake voucher for the CEH exam cost will depend on whether or not the candidate had previously taken an official prep course. For those who did sign up, it is simply a matter of paying the $100 administration charge to get a retake voucher, however, non-enrolled ones must register and also pay $499 for a retake voucher. It is important when one wants to pursue CEH certification that these costs are known and understood so as to budget well ahead.
