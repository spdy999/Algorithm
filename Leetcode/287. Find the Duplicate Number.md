```python
class Solution:
    def findDuplicate(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        s = f = 0
        # find the intersection point
        while True:
            s = nums[s] # s = s.next 
            f = nums[nums[f]] # f = f.next.next 
            if s == f:
                break

        # move both slow pts from both the intersection point together with from the start point. (proof by p = x) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjYnzkAhcNk
        s2 = 0
        while True:
            s2 = nums[s2]
            s = nums[s]
            if s == s2:
                return s
