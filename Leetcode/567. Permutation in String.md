Steps (adapt from neetcode)
- using dict for `s1Count` and `s2Count`
- and use `&` (intersection) for counting `matches`

```python
class Solution:
    def checkInclusion(self, s1: str, s2: str) -> bool:
        s1Count = dict()
        s2Count = dict()
        for lt in string.ascii_lowercase:
            s1Count[lt] = 0
            s2Count[lt] = 0

        for i in range(len(s1)):
            s1Count[s1[i]] += 1
            s2Count[s2[i]] += 1

        matches = len(s1Count.items() & s2Count.items())  # intersection

# TBC 
```
