Note:: Can decrease to O(n) but code will be messy and not necessary. just use dict check each char.

---
Steps (adapt from NeetCode)
- using ascii dict for `s1Count` and `s2Count`
- and use `&` (intersection) for counting `matches`
- iterate through s2 (`O(len_s2)`) until `match == 26` or else there's no permutation of string
