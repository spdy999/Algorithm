**user**: what is time and space complexity of this code:
class Solution:
    def checkValidString(self, s: str) -> bool:

        hqSt = []
        hqL = []
        for i,p in enumerate(list(s)):
            if p == '(':
                heappush(hqL, -i)
            if p == '*':
                heappush(hqSt, -i)
            if p == ')':
                if hqL:
                    heappop(hqL) # confirm hqL is infront of current P
                elif hqSt:
                    heappop(hqSt) # confirm hqSt is infront of current P
                else:
                    return False # ")", ")*"
        while hqL and hqSt:
            if -hqL[0] < -hqSt[0]:
                heappop(hqL)
                heappop(hqSt)
            else:
                return False
        return False if hqL else True

**ai**: Let's analyze the time and space complexity of the provided Python code.

Let `n` be the length of the input string `s`.

### Time Complexity

1.  **Initialization:**
    *   `hqSt = []` and `hqL = []` take O(1) time.

2.  **First Loop (`for i,p in enumerate(list(s))`):**
    *   `list(s)` creates a list of characters, which takes O(n) time and O(n) space. `enumerate` then iterates through this list.
    *   The loop runs `n` times (once for each character in `s`).
    *   Inside the loop:
        *   `heappush(hqL, -i)`: Pushing an element onto a heap takes O(log k) time, where `k` is the current number of elements in the heap. In the worst case, `hqL` can contain up to `n` elements. So, this is O(log n).
        *   `heappush(hqSt, -i)`: Similarly, this is O(log n).
        *   `heappop(hqL)` or `heappop(hqSt)`: Popping an element from a heap also takes O(log k) time, which is O(log n) in the worst case.
    *   Since each iteration performs at most one heap operation (push or pop), and each operation takes O(log n) time, the total time for this loop is **O(n log n)**.

3.  **Second Loop (`while hqL and hqSt`):**
    *   This loop continues as long as both heaps are not empty.
    *   In each iteration, at least one element is popped from either `hqL` or `hqSt`.
    *   The maximum number of elements initially in `hqL` or `hqSt` is `n`. Therefore, this loop will run at most `n` times (specifically, `min(len(hqL), len(hqSt))` times).
    *   Inside the loop, `hqL[0]` and `hqSt[0]` (accessing the top element) are O(1). `heappop` operations are O(log n).
    *   Thus, the total time for this loop is also **O(n log n)**.

4.  **Final Check:**
    *   `return False if hqL else True` is an O(1) operation.

Combining these, the dominant factor is O(n log n).
**Overall Time Complexity: O(n log n)**, where `n` is the length of the input string `s`.

### Space Complexity

1.  **`list(s)`:**
    *   Creating `list(s)` at the beginning of the first loop takes O(n) space to store all characters.

2.  **Heaps (`hqSt` and `hqL`):**
    *   In the worst case, `hqL` could store all '(' characters and `hqSt` could store all '*' characters. The total number of elements stored across both heaps can be up to `n` (e.g., for a string like "(((*").
    *   Therefore, the space required for the heaps is **O(n)**.

**Overall Space Complexity: O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the input string `s`.
