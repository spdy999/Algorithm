**ai**: Based on the [[Project Alpha Retrospective]] note, the key areas for improvement we should focus on next are:

1.  **Communication with external stakeholders:** Implement a more structured approach to avoid miscommunication and delays.
2.  **Documentation:** Improve internal documentation for new features to facilitate onboarding for new team members.
3.  **Testing process:** Enhance testing protocols, potentially by integrating more automated tests, to catch bugs earlier.
4.  **Resource allocation:** Conduct a resource audit and re-evaluate task distribution to ensure better load balancing among team members.
