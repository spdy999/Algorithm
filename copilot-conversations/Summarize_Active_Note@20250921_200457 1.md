**user**: Give me a quick recap of {activeNote} in two sentences.
[Timestamp: 2025/09/21 20:04:57]

**ai**: The note [[678. Valid Parenthesis String]] describes a Leetcode problem where you need to determine if a string containing '(', ')', and '*' characters is valid. A string is valid if all parentheses match correctly, with '*' being a wildcard that can represent a left parenthesis, a right parenthesis, or an empty string.

**user**: give my python code to solve this.
[Timestamp: 2025/09/21 20:05:23]

**ai**: ```python
class Solution:
    def checkValidString(self, s: str) -> bool:
        # low represents the minimum possible count of open parentheses
        # high represents the maximum possible count of open parentheses
        low = 0
        high = 0

        for char in s:
            if char == '(':
                low += 1
                high += 1
            elif char == ')':
                # If we see a ')'
                # For low: it must match an open '(', so decrement.
                # We cap low at 0 because we can't have negative open parentheses.
                low = max(0, low - 1)
                # For high: it matches an open '(', so decrement.
                high -= 1
            else:  # char == '*'
                # If we see a '*'
                # For low: treat '*' as a ')' to minimize open parentheses.
                low = max(0, low - 1)
                # For high: treat '*' as a '(' to maximize open parentheses.
                high += 1

            # If high becomes negative at any point, it means we have too many
            # closing parentheses even when all '*' are treated as opening ones
            # or empty strings. This makes the string invalid.
            if high < 0:
                return False

        # After iterating through the entire string, for the string to be valid,
        # the minimum possible count of open parentheses must be 0.
        # This ensures that all opening parentheses can be matched.
        return low == 0

**user**: what is time and space complexity for the code you generated?
[Timestamp: 2025/09/21 20:06:09]

**ai**: The time complexity for the generated code is **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the input string `s`. This is because the code iterates through the string exactly once.

The space complexity is **O(1)**, as it only uses a few constant-space variables (`low`, `high`) regardless of the input string's length.
