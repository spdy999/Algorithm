Progress:: Completed

Difficulty:: 
Time:: `O(n * log max(piles))`
Tags:: 
Techniques:: [[Binary search Tree (BST)]]
Sites:: [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problems/koko-eating-bananas/description/)
Walkthrough:: [Koko Eating Bananas - Binary Search - Leetcode 875 - Python - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2SozAs9RzA)
Note:: Reasonable. My first thought is quite correct. it's not clean BST and O(log n). Need to sacrifice looping piles to sum up to find min hours
