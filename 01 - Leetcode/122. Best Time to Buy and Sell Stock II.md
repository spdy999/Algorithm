Note: Actually the concept is easier than [[121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock]]. But... you need to understand the concept first. <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">just sum all the profit you can make.</mark> (easy as this, no need to think about max, min or any greedy)

```python
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        profit = 0
        n = len(prices)

        for i in range(n - 1):
            diff = prices[i + 1] - prices[i]
            if diff > 0:
                profit += diff
        return profit
```
