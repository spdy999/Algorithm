# 1584. Min Cost to Connect All Points
---
![[1584. Min Cost to Connect All Points 2025-06-10 23.40.54.excalidraw]]
## Method 1: [[Prim]]
[[1584.min-cost-to-connect-all-points_prim.py]]
Steps:
1. build edges using [[Hashmap]]
	1. maybe [[77. Combinations]] to help
2. [[04-Techniques/Greedy/Prim]] to find [[Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)]]

Time: `O(N^2 LogN)`
Space: `O(N^2)`


## Method 2: [[Union Find]]
[[1584.min-cost-to-connect-all-points_unionfind.py]]
Steps:
1. create sorted edges (by weight)
2. use [[Union Find]] to find MST

Time: `O(N^2 LogN)`
Space: `O(N^2)`
