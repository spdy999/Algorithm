# 62. Unique Paths
---
There is a robot on an `m x n` grid. The robot is initially located at the **top-left corner** (i.e., `grid[0][0]`). The robot tries to move to the **bottom-right corner** (i.e., `grid[m - 1][n - 1]`). The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time.

Given the two integers `m` and `n`, return _the number of possible unique paths that the robot can take to reach the bottom-right corner_.

The test cases are generated so that the answer will be less than or equal to `2 * 109`.

**Example 1:**

![[8f56b1578c11fd121400732810ce8a5b_MD5.png]]

**Input:** m = 3, n = 7
**Output:** 28

**Example 2:**

**Input:** m = 3, n = 2
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** From the top-left corner, there are a total of 3 ways to reach the bottom-right corner:
1. Right -> Down -> Down
2. Down -> Down -> Right
3. Down -> Right -> Down

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= m, n <= 100`
