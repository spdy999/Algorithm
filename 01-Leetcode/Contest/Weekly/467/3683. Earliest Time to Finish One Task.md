# 3683. Earliest Time to Finish One Task
---
You are given a 2D integer array `tasks` where `tasks[i] = [si, ti]`.

Each `[si, ti]` in `tasks` represents a task with start time `si` that takes `ti` units of time to finish.

Return the earliest time at which at least one task is finished.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** tasks = `[[1,6],[2,3]]`

**Output:** 5

**Explanation:**

The first task starts at time `t = 1` and finishes at time `1 + 6 = 7`. The second task finishes at time `2 + 3 = 5`. You can finish one task at time 5.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** tasks = `[[100,100],[100,100],[100,100]]`

**Output:** 200

**Explanation:**

All three tasks finish at time `100 + 100 = 200`.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= tasks.length <= 100`
- `tasks[i] = [si, ti]`
- `1 <= si, ti <= 100`
