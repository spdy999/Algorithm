In this problem, a tree is an **undirected graph** that is connected and has no cycles.

You are given a graph that started as a tree with `n` nodes labeled from `1` to `n`, with one additional edge added. The added edge has two **different** vertices chosen from `1` to `n`, and was not an edge that already existed. The graph is represented as an array `edges` of length `n` where `edges[i] = [ai, bi]` indicates that there is an edge between nodes `ai` and `bi` in the graph.

Return _an <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">edge that can be removed</mark> so that the resulting graph is a tree of_ `n` _nodes_. If there are multiple answers, return the answer that occurs last in the input.

**Example 1:**

![[8f22ae2c865fcea2118c4aefa69192b2_MD5.jpg]]

**Input:** edges = `[[1,2],[1,3],[2,3]]`
**Output:** [2,3]

**Example 2:**

![[18c03e09c7898c0793b3577bb15754df_MD5.jpg]]

**Input:** edges = `[[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[1,4],[1,5]]`
**Output:** [1,4]

**Constraints:**

- `n == edges.length`
- `3 <= n <= 1000`
- `edges[i].length == 2`
- `1 <= ai < bi <= edges.length`
- `ai != bi`
- There are no repeated edges.
- The given graph is connected.
