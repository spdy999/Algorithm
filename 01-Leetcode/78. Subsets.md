# BF
## [[Backtracking]]
[[78.subsets.py]]
- Time : `O(2^N)`

![[78. Subsets 2024-03-06 12.56.06.excalidraw]]

- The index is from `1` for easy to understand (actually it's from `0`)



## Another [[Backtracking]]
[[78.subsets_quadratic.py]]
- Time : `O(N*2N)` #Quadratic
- Space : `O(N*2N)`
![[78. Subsets 2025-08-14 14.11.46.excalidraw]]

## Trivia
- [[78. Subsets]] vs [[77. Combinations]]
	- ![[78. Subsets 2025-09-05 22.17.10.excalidraw|400]]
	- all possible combination (from 0 to n) <===> เลือก (fix size)
