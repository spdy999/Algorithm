# 374. Guess Number Higher or Lower
---
We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:

I pick a number from `1` to `n`. You have to guess which number I picked (the number I picked stays the same throughout the game).

Every time you guess wrong, I will tell you whether the number I picked is higher or lower than your guess.

You call a pre-defined API `int guess(int num)`, which returns three possible results:

- `-1`: Your guess is higher than the number I picked (i.e. `num > pick`).
- `1`: Your guess is lower than the number I picked (i.e. `num < pick`).
- `0`: your guess is equal to the number I picked (i.e. `num == pick`).

Return _the number that I picked_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 10, pick = 6
**Output:** 6

**Example 2:**

**Input:** n = 1, pick = 1
**Output:** 1

**Example 3:**

**Input:** n = 2, pick = 1
**Output:** 1

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= n <= 231 - 1`
- `1 <= pick <= n`
