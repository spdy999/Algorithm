# 238. Product of Array Except Self
---
### 3 cases
- no 0 => all prod / self
	```
	Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
	Output: [24,12,8,6]
	```
- 0  => everything apart from 0 (index) will be zero
	```
	Input: nums = [-1,1,0,-3,3]
	Output: [0,0,9,0,0]
	```
- 0s => everything will be 0
	```
	Input: nums = [-1,0,0,-3,3]
	Output: [0,0,0,0,0]
