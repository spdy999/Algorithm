# Counting sort

- Time complexity ⇒ `O(n)`
- Have to know `min` , `max`
- The range of value is resonable ⇒ `min` and `max` not tooooooo large from each other
    - Array **length = 10**
    - But! Hold **value of 1 to a million!!!!!!**
    - So, this array is **not** a good candidate for Counting sort.
