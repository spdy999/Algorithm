Key Points Summary:
- <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Multi-dimensional</mark> dynamic programming (DP) problems are <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">more complex</mark> due to <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">multiple state variables</mark> involved.
- Common state variables for these DP problems are indices, constraints, and statuses.
- Immutable data structures, such as numbers and strings, are preferred for memoization in multi-dimensional DP problems.
- The content serves as an introduction to the intricacies of multi-dimensional DP and how to approach solving them.
